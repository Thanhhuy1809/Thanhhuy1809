# Hello, I’m Huy Thành  
## AI Engineer | Computer Vision | Deep Learning | IoT | Robotics  

I am a student majoring in Computer Engineering at Da Nang University of Science and Technology (DUT).  
My focus is on artificial intelligence, computer vision, embedded systems, and intelligent traffic solutions.

I enjoy building complete end-to-end products:  
from data processing, model training, system logic, to deployment and UI integration.
